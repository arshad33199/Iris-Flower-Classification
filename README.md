# Iris-Flower-Classification
## Introduction
In this article of Iris Flowers Classification, we will be dealing with Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine Learning Algorithm. First, we will see Support Vector, and then we will understand the working of an algorithm with the Iris flowers dataset. We all know about Iris Dataset, and it contains features of different flower species. Independent features in this dataset are Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. All these lengths were in centimeters. And Dependent feature, which will be the output for the model, is Species. It contains the name of the species to which that particular flower with those measurements belongs.
